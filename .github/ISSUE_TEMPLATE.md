[output goes here]
```

If your problem is weird, please also run `octave_app_diagnostic_dump` in Octave.app and attach its output file to this issue.

If your problem is Octave.app freezing with a spinning “beachball” mouse cursor, if you can, please take a spindump, zip it, and attach it to this issue. (To create a spindump, open Activity Monitor while Octave.app is frozen, select the `octave-gui` process, click the “gear” button in the upper left, and choose "Spindump".)
